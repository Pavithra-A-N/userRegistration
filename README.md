# UserRegistration

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Possible Optimisation
1. Moving all the imports of Angular material to separate file (could have done in production env)
2. SCSS files can be more optimised with seggregations
3. Wild card routes addition
4. Error Handling in separate file according to status codes and User Friendly error message display
5. Add test specification we need to do core testing via angular

## Things that can be done better
1. More styling in scss can be done but kept simple

## Used Technologies
1. NgRx Store
2. Angular Material
3. Typescript
4. SCSS

## Problems faced
1. CORS issue , Tried multiple ways to solve it. (Note: Thank you on this , it was a good learning time)
2. Intially thought of creating reusable widget level in forms 
   Example: Since every forms has only textbox , I thought of customizing at formControl level which i couldn't figure a way yet.
   Instead created a form level reusable components

## Awaiting on your comments to learn more.
